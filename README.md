# Sourdough
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/TruRooms/sourdough.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/TruRooms/sourdough)

An api wrapper for the Bread Financing Backend API.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'sourdough'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install sourdough

## Usage

### Configuration

This gem expects your api key and secret key to be configured. An optional 3rd param tells Sourdough whether to run against the sandbox API or the production version. This can be included in a Rails initializer.
```ruby
Sourdough.api_key = 'MY_API_KEY'
Sourdough.secret_key = 'MY_SECRET_KEY'
Sourdough.sandbox = true # OPTIONAL
```

### Endpoints

Where possible, an endpoint will return an instance of the object as a convenience. EG `cart = Sourdough::Cart.find('1'); cart.email`

#### Transactions

#### Carts

##### .find(cart_id)
```ruby
cart = Sourdough.cart.find('1')
pp cart.body
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
